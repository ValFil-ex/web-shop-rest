# Web-Shop Page #

##Basic web-shop page created using principles of RESTful APIs

###Frontend: 
- JS/JQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- I tried to structure code using MVC and OOP principles
-  http requests (ajax calls) to retrieve actual data from backend 

###Backend:
- php, mysql
- code structured using mvc pattern 
- requests from frontend are routed in controller to make queries in DB and respond with JSON output 
- user data for cart simulation functionality is stored as $_SESSION variable for this demo
